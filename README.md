# C++ Modules

![C++](cpp.png)

A comprehensive collection of C++ exercises and projects designed to master Object-Oriented Programming concepts and advanced C++ features. This repository contains 10 modules (cpp00 through cpp09) with progressively challenging exercises that cover fundamental to advanced C++ programming concepts.

## üìö Repository Overview

This repository is part of the 42 School curriculum and focuses on learning C++ programming from the ground up. Each module builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and reinforcing previously learned material.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

- Master Object-Oriented Programming principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- Understand C++98 standard and its constraints
- Learn memory management and RAII principles
- Practice advanced C++ features (Templates, STL, Exception Handling)
- Develop clean, efficient, and maintainable C++ code

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS)
- C++ compiler supporting C++98 standard (g++ or clang++)
- Make utility
- Bash shell

### Compilation

Each exercise contains a `Makefile` for easy compilation:

```bash
# Navigate to any exercise directory
cd cpp00/ex00

# Compile the project
make

# Run the executable (name varies by exercise)
./megaphone

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Clean everything including executables
make fclean

# Recompile everything
make re
```

### Automated Testing

Use the provided grading script to test all exercises at once:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x grademe.sh

# Run automated tests for all modules
./grademe.sh
```

For detailed information about the grading script, see [GRADEME_README.md](GRADEME_README.md).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation Standards

All exercises are compiled with the following flags:
```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
```

### Important Notes:
- **C++98 Standard**: All code must be compatible with C++98
- **No external libraries**: Only standard library functions are allowed
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Classes should implement the "Rule of Three" when applicable
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks allowed - proper cleanup required
- **Coding Standards**: Follow 42 School coding standards

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
Each exercise can be tested individually:
```bash
cd cppXX/exXX
make
./executable_name [arguments]
make fclean
```

### Automated Testing
Use the provided script for comprehensive testing:
```bash
./grademe.sh
```

The script will:
- Compile all exercises
- Run basic functionality tests
- Report success/failure rates
- Provide colored output for easy reading
